# Hola.

For this first contribution, I did the following:

- create a fork of the repository and within it a branch for my contributions.
- initialize the project with Vite for easier configuration (see vite.md for more info)
- initialize npm and git.
- install tailwind, so you can see an alternative to Sass (you can see a comparison of the full project in project-analysis.md).
- add some basic design.
- work on the JavaScript so it works as we discussed: taking inputs, returning an output that is a prompt to pass to an AI.
- documente several things, and added some Markdown files with additional information.

Also I create a README that maybe will help you. The project needs a LICENCE.txt file.
The resposiveness is working right and different screen sizes, but not all are tested.
If you have some questions, send me an email ðŸš€
