# Hello. 

For this contribution, I did the following:

- I created a fork of the repository and within it a branch for my contributions.
- I initialized npm and git.
- I installed tailwind so you can see an alternative to Sass (you can see the bundle size comparison).
- I added some basic flat design styles.
- I worked on the JavaScript so it works as we discussed: taking inputs, returning an output that is a prompt to pass to an AI.
- I documented several things, and added some Markdown files with additional information.
